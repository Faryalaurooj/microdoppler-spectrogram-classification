The provided code snippet facilitates the augmentation of spectrogram images for three classes: Copper, Aluminum, 
and Brass. Initially, it loads eight original spectrogram images for each class from the specified directory. 
Subsequently, using an ImageDataGenerator, it applies various augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, 
shearing, zooming, and flipping to create diverse image variations. These augmentations result in the generation 
of ten additional images for each original spectrogram, leading to a total of 88 images per class after augmentation.
Consequently, across all three classes, the total number of augmented images amounts to 264. 
This augmentation process enhances the diversity and robustness of the dataset, potentially 
improving the performance and generalization capability of machine learning models trained on spectrogram 
image data



This Python script performs data augmentation on spectrogram images for classification tasks:

    Data Loading: It defines a function load_spectrograms(directory) to load spectrogram images and their corresponding labels from a specified directory. It iterates through each class subfolder, reads each image file ending with '.png' using OpenCV (cv2), converts it to grayscale, resizes it to a predefined dimension (256x256), and stores the spectrograms along with their labels in lists.

    Data Augmentation: Using ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow's Keras API, it defines augmentation parameters such as rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and flipping, to create diverse variations of the spectrogram images.

    Augmentation Resolutions: It defines different resolutions (64x64, 96x96, 128x128, and 256x256) for augmentation to generate a variety of augmented images.

    Augmentation Process: For each class of spectrogram images, it applies augmentation techniques to create additional images and saves them to subfolders within the 'augmented_data3' directory based on their resolution.

    Completion Message: After completing the augmentation process, it prints a message indicating the completion of data augmentation and the location where the augmented images are saved.
